# SketchyMenu
I went down a rabbit hole and now there are these plugins for FelixKratz's [SketchyBar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar).

## Items / Plugins
- **[SketchyMenu](sketchybar/plugins/sketchymenu/)** (item: [`sketchymenu.sh`](sketchybar/items/menu.sh)): A plugin to show a functional and clickable pop-out menu that has all the stuff from what would normally be across the top menu bar.
- **[Notifications](sketchybar/plugins/notifications.sh)** (item: [`notifs.sh`](sketchybar/items/notifs.sh)): A plugin to show macOS notifications in SketchyBar dynamically as the show up. Click the icon to open that app.

## Shameless Plug
Think this is great?

Over the next few months some amazing AI research is going to start popping up over at my company's org. Check it out on occasion: [Ardea's GitHub](https://github.com/ArdeaAI)

We're evolving stuff to let sand realize it is sand!
